# Greening the Apple : Journey to Carbon Neutrality | Maven Environmental Challenge

## Objective:
As an independent journalist and data visualization enthusiast, my project aims to create informative and visually engaging representations of Apple's progress toward achieving carbon neutrality by 2030. Apple pledged to reduce its carbon emissions by 75% from the 2015 baseline and offset the remaining 25% to achieve a net-zero carbon footprint.

## Data Description:
To complete the challenge, I have utilized data from Apple's Environmental Progress Reports 
and specifically, the three tables provided by Maven Analytics for the environmental challenge.
Below is the data dictionary for the tables used:

## Approach:
Developed an interactive dashboard provides a dynamic visual journey through Apple's path to carbon neutrality. It features clear and concise graphs, charts, and infographics. Focus areas:
Emission Progress: Track Apple's progress towards the 75% emissions reduction goal by 2030. Interactive charts show year-by-year emissions changes.
Product Impact: Explore the carbon footprint of baseline iPhone models released from 2015 to 2022, highlighting the role of product life cycles in emissions reduction.
Financial Alignment: See how Apple's environmental goals align with key financial and operational metrics, with visual comparisons of revenue, market capitalization, and employee data.
In conclusion, Apple's report insights proves that there isn’t need to be a trade-off between what’s good for the planet and what’s good for business. This means that they seek out climate solutions that are cost competitive, offer a financial return, benefit business and environment, providing the positive outcome to the goals set to calculate, then reduce the carbon footprint to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030.
